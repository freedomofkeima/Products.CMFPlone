Changelog
=========

5.2a1 (unreleased)
------------------

Breaking changes:

- Remove all dependencies on plone.app.controlpanel. 
  Third party code need either to depend on plone.app.controlpanel 4.0,
  which is a backward compatibilit package only, or also update to not depend on it anymore.
- *add item here*

New features:

- Adapt code and tests to the new indexing operations queueing.
  Part of PLIP 1343: https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/1343
  [gforcada]

Bug fixes:

- Show version of products in Add-ons control panel configlet.
  This fixes https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/1472.
- Remove last legacy Javascript ``highlight-searchterms.js``. 
  Removes also the skins folder ``plone_ecmascript``. 
  It was broken for almost all use cases (Google, other search engines, own live search);
  JS worked only when coming from Plone detailed search page.
  [jensens]

- Get rid of obsolete ``X-UA-Compatible`` header.
  [hvelarde]

- Resource registry legacy bundle cooking: Exit early with a warning, if preconditions to build are not given (no compilation paths).
  Allow cooking CSS, even if no JS is defined.
  Log all important steps of the cooking process.
  [thet]

- Remove unused ``plone.css`` from static repository.
  [thet]

- Check for ``AccessInactivePortalContent`` for each path in a catalog query.
  This solves a problem, where Editors couldn't see inactive content, even though they had the required permission on a subpath of the portal (e.g. a subsite).
  [thet]

- Remove last legacy Javascript ``highlight-searchterms.js``. 
  Removes also the skins folder ``plone_ecmascript``. 
  It was broken for all (Google, other search engines, own live search);
  JS worked only when coming from Plone detailed search.

5.1b2 (2017-02-20)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Fix packaging error.
  [esteele]

5.1b1 (2017-02-20)
------------------

Breaking changes:

- Add helper method to get all catalog entries from a given catalog: ``Products.CMFPlone.CatalogTool.catalog_get_all``.
  In Products.ZCatalog before 4.0 a catalog call without a query returned all catalog brains.
  This can be used as a replacement where it is needed, for exampe in tests.
  [thet, gogobd]

- Remove ``query_request`` from CatalogTool's search method, as it isn't supported in Products.ZCatalog 4 anymore.
  [thet]

- Removed our patch that added ``secureSend`` to the ``MailHost``.
  This was originally scheduled for removal in Plone 5.0.  See `issue
  965 <https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/965>`_.
  [maurits]

- The related items widget has changed a lot.
  See the Mockup changelog for 2.4.0 here: https://github.com/plone/mockup/blob/master/CHANGES.rst

- All css classes named ``enableUnloadProtection`` were changed to ``pat-formunloadalert`` to trigger that pattern.
  Templates using ``enableUnloadProtection`` should change to ``pat-formunloadalert`` too.
  This change shouldn't impact too much, because the form unload protection didn't work at all in Plone 5 until now.
  [thet]

- MimetypesRegistry icons are now a browser resource directory instead of skins folder.
  [jensens]

- Remove unused ``plone_scripts`` (not used nor tested anywhere in coredev) [jensens, davisagli]

  - ``mark_view`` (use ``@@plone_layout/mark_view``)
  - ``hide_columns`` (use ``@@plone_layout/hide_columns``)
  - ``icons_visible`` (use ``@@plone_layout/icons_visible``)
  - ``getIcon`` (use ``@@plone_layout/getIcon``)
  - ``have_portlets`` (use ``@@plone_layout/have_portlets``)
  - ``bodyClass`` (use ``@@plone_layout/bodyClass``)
  [davisagli]

- Move plone_content skin templates into Products.ATContentTypes as browser views.
  [gforcada]

New features:

- Added ``ok`` view.  This is useful for automated checks, for example
  httpok, to see if the site is still available.  It returns the text
  ``OK`` and sets headers to avoid caching.
  [maurits]

- Make contact form extensible. This fixes https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/1879.
  [timo]

- Don't minify CSS or JavaScript resources if they end with ``.min.css`` resp. ``.min.js``.
  [thet]

  [thet]

- Add utility method to retrieve the top most parent request from a sub request.
  [thet]

- Add ``mockup-patterns-relateditems-upload`` resource, which can be used in custom bundles to add the upload feature in the related items widget.
  [thet]

- Move ``get_top_site_from_url`` from plone.app.content to ``utils.py`` and make it robust against unicode paths.
  This function allows in virtual hosting environments to acquire the top most visible portal object to operate on.
  It is used for example to calculate the correct virtual root objects for Mockup's related items and structure pattern.
  [thet]

- Add sort_on field to search controlpanel.
  [rodfersou]

- PLIP 1340: Deprecate portal_quickinstaller.
  You should no longer use CMFQuickInstallerTool methods, but GenericSetup profiles.

  [maurits]

- Include mockup 2.4.0.
  [thet]

  [jensens]

- Resource Registry:
  In ``debug-mode`` (zope.conf, buildout) do not ignore development mode for anonymous users.
  [jensens]

- Resource Registry: If file system version is newer than ``last_compilation`` date of a bundle, use this as ``last_compilation`` date.
  [jensens]

- New browser view based login code - merged from plone.login (credits to esteele, pbauer, agitator, jensens, et al).
  `portal_skins/plone_login` is now gone, see PLIP #2092.
  Also, password reset view moved to login subfolder to keep things together.
  Some testbrowser based tests needed changes because of z3c.form based login form .
  The Plone specific, rarely used cross site __ac cookie SSO feature/hack was removed.
  In case somebody needs this, please make it an addon package.
  Better use a field proven, more secure way, like OAuth2, Shibboleth or someting similar.
  [jensens, et al]

- Adapt tests to `Products.GenericSetup >= 2.0` thus requiring at least that
  version.
